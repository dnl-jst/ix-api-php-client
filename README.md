# IX-API PHP Client

[![Latest Stable Version][packagist-image]][packagist-url]
[![Github Issues][github-issues-image]][github-issues-url]

An unofficial lightweight PHP API client for the [IX-API](https://ix-api.net).

## Installation

To install, run `composer require dant89/ixapi-client` in the root of your project or add `dant89/ix-api-client` to your composer.json.
```json
"require": {
    "dant89/ix-api-client": "^LATEST_VERSION_TAG"
}
```

## Usage

Use your provided key / secret credentials for the given implementor URL to return and then set a bearer token:

```php
use Dant89\IXAPIClient\Client;

// Create base client
$client = new Client(IXAPI_URL);

// Get a bearer token from key / secret
$response = $client->getHttpClient('auth')
    ->postAuthToken(IXAPI_KEY, IXAPI_SECRET);

// Check for valid response status
if ($response->getStatus() === 200) {
    $data = $response->getContent();
    $client->setBearerToken($data['access_token']);
}
```

With the bearer token set, you can return data from all endpoints that require authentication, such as the products endpoints:
```php
// Query for products
$response = $client->getHttpClient('products')
    ->getProducts();

// Check for valid response and set the array of products
if ($response->getStatus() === 200) {
    $products = $response->getContent();
}
````

## Authentication

You will need to speak directly to an exchange to be provided with an API key / secret combination and the URL of their IX-API implementation.

## Questions

Q. The IX-API is OpenAPI 3 compliant, why don't I just create a client using a tool such as [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)?

A. Please do! This client is intended to be very lightweight and something you can use to jump in, build on and experiment with. Clients generated by automated tools, such as [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) can have more depth and functionality that you may find your application requires.
